# How to Create a Workload #
========================

Workloads in nOps help you to group different AWS resources that have been created within your AWS environment. This makes it easier to carry out various assessments on those specific services that make up with _Workload_. These are the steps to create a workload in nOps.

Access **Workloads** by clicking Workloads from the tabs.

Creating a workload is as easy as selecting the **Workloads** tab and clicking the **Add New Workload** button on the top right. Once a workload is created you can edit it to add or remove resources. Note that you **_cannot_** rename a workload, but you can always create a new one.

### What to know before you begin ###
-----------------------------

nOps offers the following review types and compliance frameworks

**Review Types**

*   Well Architected Framework Review (WAFR)
    
*   Foundational Technical Review (FTR)  
    Software as a Service (SaaS)
    
*   Serverless.
    

**Compliance Frameworks**

*   HIPAA
    
*   SOC2
    
*   CIS
    

### Creating Your First Workload ###
----------------------------

If this is the first time you have created a workload, you will click “**Create new Workload**” in the middle of the screen. After that, the **Create new Workload** button will move to the top right of the window.

**To Create a new Workload**

1.  Click the **Create New Workload** button to create a new workload. This opens a dialog with a form to fill for creating the **_Workload_**
    
2.  Enter the following information:.
