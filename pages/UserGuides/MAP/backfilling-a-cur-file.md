# Backfilling a CUR file for the MAP program #

If you're participating in AWS's Migration Assistance Program, you want to get the maximum credit from the MAP program.

One thing to consider is a longer trail of data within your Cost and Usage Report (CUR).  In order to get the most out of nOps, we recommend filling out a support ticket with AWS to do a CUR backfill.  This will load your CUR file with previous months' data, allowing you to get better insight.
