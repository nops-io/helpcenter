# Getting Started with ShareSave

#### ShareSave provides risk-free Auto-pilot EC2, RDS, ElasticCache, OpenSearch, and Redshift Reserved Instances Management. ####


ShareSave is ideal for organizations that are growing rapidly and are having difficulties keeping track of everything ranging from server side, CMS stack, API stack, analytics, to linear playout engine.

ShareSave is also ideal for organizations that, during their rapid expansion, over-buy reserved instances at an alarming rate to keep up with the demands and it is now difficult for them to wind down after everything settles. ShareSave can not only help during their expansion but also helps save a substantial percentage on monthly AWS costs with the help of ShareSave RI management, ShareSave Scheduler, and ShareSave Graviton programs.

## ShareSave Automations ##
=====================

The following is the list of cost-saving automation under ShareSave:

*   [Risk-Free Commitment](https://www.nops.io/sharesave/)
    
*   Graviton
    
*   [nSwitch Resource Scheduler](https://www.nops.io/sharesave-scheduler/)
    
*   Amazon Relational Database Service
    

### Risk-Free Commitment ###
--------------------

Real-time, risk-free, hands-free automatic life-cycle management of Amazon EC2 and RDS commitments.

The ShareSave AI engine collects Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail logs and continuously monitors and analyzes infrastructure usage data points. It then automatically reacts in real time by purchasing RIs upon an increase in compute usage and selling RIs upon a decrease in compute usage. nOps continuously purchases and sells commitments on an hourly basis, depending on your infrastructure’s capacity changes.

ShareSave grabs the most lucrative discounts in the Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance Marketplace.

### Graviton ###
--------

Switching workloads to AWS Graviton-based instances that provide the best price-performance for workloads in Amazon EC2.

### Resource Scheduler ###
------------------

nOps ShareSave Resource Scheduler makes it easy to pause resources during inactivity and leverages the Amazon EventBridge bus to deliver signals to resources to stop them during inactivity and restart them when they are most likely to be used automatically.

### Auto Scaling Groups ###
-------------------

A data-driven approach to recommending new autoscaling configurations and real-time optimization opportunities based on your actual usage:

*   Determine your group's idle resources using statistical analysis based on the group’s utilization data.
    

*   Reconfigure your autoscaling group based on actual usage.
    
*   The most optimal personalized configuration based on your historical utilization data.
    
*   Keep only the amount of resources you need.
    

Low and no code, one-click automation built into every recommendation you see.

### Amazon Relational Database Service ###
----------------------------------

The RDS recommendations clearly describe the optimization approach you should take and shows the recommendations to implement.

nOps looks at the utilization metrics and determines time periods when RDS instances are running but are inactive. The insights that nOps gather from your utilization partners turn into scheduling recommendations that you can implement to immediately start savings and reducing your spend.

## ShareSave Dashboard ##
===================

The Sharesave Dashboard provides clear visibility of the potential savings that can be achieved using the nOps Platform. The ShareSave program is able to process 6 months' worth of data.

nOps continually refines its savings recommendations and strives to take ShareSave to absolute perfection.

The ShareSave Dashboard consists of three sections:

1.  Savings Summary and Breakdown
    
2.  List of Opportunities
    
3.  Filter
    

### Savings Summary and Breakdown ###
-----------------------------

In the Savings Summary, you will find:

*   **Lost Opportunities —** Money you could have saved, if you had signed up for nOps ShareSave, in the last 60 days.
    
*   **Estimated Total Saving —** Estimated saving nOps ShareSave for the specified time period (MTD, 7 Days, 30 Days, 60 Days, 90 Days).
    
*   **Estimated Total ShareSave Fee —** What we will charge for saving your money.
    
*   **Estimated NET Savings —** What you Save after paying nOps.
    
*   **Net Savings % —** The percentage of costs that you saved vs on-demand
    
*   **Estimated Annualized Net Savings —** What you will save in a year with ShareSave (Estimated savings vs on-demand with ShareSave).

## Prerequisites ##
=============

You must have access to your _AWS Master Payer Account ID_. With this ID, we will be able to generate a $5 Market Place Private Offer (MPPO) and send it over to you. It's very easy to accept the offer and onboard an account.

nOps recommends that you link your AWS accounts to nOps with [Automatic Setup](https://docs.nops.io/en/articles/4779288-adding-an-aws-account-to-nops-with-automatic-setup). If you are an advanced AWS user and have specific requirements, you can also link your account to nOps with [Manual Setup](https://docs.nops.io/en/articles/5964759-adding-an-aws-account-to-nops-with-manual-setup), [Multi-Account Setup with Terraform](https://docs.nops.io/en/articles/6464661-adding-multiple-aws-accounts-to-nops-with-terraform), and [Multi-Account Setup with CloudFormation](https://docs.nops.io/en/articles/6573014-adding-multiple-aws-account-to-nops-with-cloudformation).

If you are an existing nOps customer, in order to get access to all the cost saving features of ShareSave, you might need to update the IAM permissions for nOps. To update the IAM permissions:

1.  Log into your nOps account.
    
2.  Click on your profile name in the top right corner.
    
3.  Navigate to the **IAM Policy Update** section. You will see a list of your AWS accounts associated with nOps.
    
4.  Click the **Update on AWS** button against your master payer account. Make sure that you are already logged in to your master payer account before you click the button.
    
5.  Click the **Update on AWS** button against all associated accounts. Make sure that you are already logged in to the respective AWS account before you click the button **(optional)**.
    

## ShareSave Configuration ##
=======================

In the scope of this document, we will go through the configuration of **ShareSave - List of Risk-Free Commitments**.

To learn about **ShareSave - Resource Scheduler** and its configuration, see [Utilize nOps Resource Scheduler with EventBridge Integration to Reduce Costs Automatically](https://docs.nops.io/en/articles/6626468-utilize-nops-resource-scheduler-with-eventbridge-integration-to-reduce-costs-automatically). To learn about the **ShareSave - List of Graviton** and its configuration, see [Graviton](https://docs.nops.io/en/articles/6663048-graviton).

To configure **ShareSave - List of Risk-free Commitment**, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to your nOps environment and head over to the **ShareSave** dashboard:
