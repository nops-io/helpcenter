The tabs show different aspects for which notifications can be configured for. They are; **_Cost_, _nOps Rules_, _Security Dashboard_, _SOC2 Readiness Report_, _HIPAA Readiness Report_ and CIS Readiness Report.**

There is also the option of Slack notification with the label **_Receive notifications on Slack (optional)_.**
