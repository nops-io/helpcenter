    1.  _Trusted Entity Type_: AWS Account
    2.  _Trusted Entity_: nOps
    3.  _Role name_: nops-sharesave-payer
    4.  _IAM Policy for the Role_: [IAM Policy](#aws-sharesave-payer-iam-policy)
    5.  _Automated Creation_: [YAML File](#sharesave-yaml-file)
2.  nOps will link **two nOps ShareSave accounts** to your AWS Organization in your AWS Payer/Management account:  
    
    1.  **ShareSave Compute &lt;xx&gt;** – used by nOps to buy/sell EC2 3-year Standard Reserved Instances and buy 3-year Compute Savings Plans.  
        1. _Trusted Entity Type_: AWS Account_Trusted 
        2. _Entity_: nOps
        3. _Role name_: nops-sharesave-ri
        4. _IAM Policy for the Role_: [IAM Policy](#sharesave-iam-role)
        5. _Automated Creation_: NA – preloaded  
            
    
    1.  **ShareSave Other &lt;xx&gt;** – used by nOps to buy current generation/flexible 1-year Reserved Instances for RDS, Redshift, OpenSearch, and ElasticCache.  
        1.  _Trusted Entity Type_: AWS Account
        2.  _Trusted Entity_: nOps
        3.  _Role name_: nops-sharesave-ri
        4.  _IAM Policy for the Role_: [IAM Policy](#sharesave-iam-role)
        5.  _Automated Creation_: NA – preloaded

    2.  **Before you click Proceed, make sure that you’re logged in to your AWS Payer/Management account in the same browser.**
5.  After you click **Proceed**, nOps will take you to your AWS console’s CloudFormation **Quick create stack** page —with all the required information pre-filled  
    **Acknowledge** and click **Create stack**:
    ![](https://nops-docs-img.s3.amazonaws.com/gettingstarted/gs-create-stack.png)
