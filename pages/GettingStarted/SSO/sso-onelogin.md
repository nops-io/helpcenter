# How to use OneLogin SSO for nOps #


nOps supports SSO using OneLogin.

While implementing SSO (single sign on), we recommend opening 2 browser tabs. In one tab open and log into your nOps account, in the other open your OneLogin account. You will need to copy information from one application to the other in order to sync the information and to allow SSO access with OneLogin.

**This topic is for Clients using an Administrator Role.**

You will complete the following steps:

    Enable the **SSO login** toggle
    
    Select the **OneLogin** option  for **Select SSO Type**
    
4.  Now navigate to theOneLogin app. You will return to this page to add: Issuer URL (entityId), SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP) , and X.509 Certificatebfrom OneLogin.
