# How to Attach Documents to Workloads #
====================================

Workloads in nOps help you to group different AWS resources that have been created within your AWS environment. This makes it easier to carry out various assessments on those specific services that make up with _Workload_. These are the steps to create a workload in nOps

Click on the **_Workload_** link on the top menu bar.

Click on any of the workloads to view details and assessments under that workload
